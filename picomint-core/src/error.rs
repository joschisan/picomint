//! Every error a daemon hands back over its admin socket is a `thiserror`
//! enum deriving [`ErrorCode`]: the variant names the code, the `#[error]`
//! message explains it. The daemon puts both in the JSON error body, and
//! the CLI's `--help` lists every code a command fails with, from the same
//! enum, so the list cannot drift from what the daemon returns. The derive
//! is [`picomint_derive::ErrorCode`], re-exported here.
